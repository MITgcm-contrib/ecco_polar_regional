This simulation was conducted using MITgcm (version c66j).

The model code and input correspond to the study:

Climate-driven changes in Antarctic Bottom Water formation at Cape Darnley over the past 440 ka

Yusuke Suganuma, Vigan Mensah, Osamu Seki, Kay I. Ohshima, Minoru Ikehara (in preparation).

This repository contains the source code and input files required to reproduce the model simulations at 40 m vertical resolution and 2 km horizontal resolution.

Please note that some large input files are not included due to file size limitations.
If you would like to access the complete code and all input files used for the sensitivity experiments, please contact Keiko Takehara directly.


(Contents)
The repository includes the following files:

- code.zip
  Source code required to run the MITgcm simulation at 40 m vertical and 2 km horizontal resolution.

- input1.zip
  Input files for the control run (Same as Minsha et al., 2021). 

- input2.zip
  Input files for the +2 °C air temperature experiment.

- input3.zip
  Input files for the +1 °C surface water temperature experiment.

- input4.zip
  Input files for the −0.4 salinity experiment.

- input5.zip
  Input files for Scenario 1 (combined forcing).

- input6.zip
  Input files for Scenario 2 (combined forcing with stronger surface freshening).

All simulations were conducted using the same spatial resolution, differing only in the imposed environmental forcing.
